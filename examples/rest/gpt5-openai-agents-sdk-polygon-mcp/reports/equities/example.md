Analyst ratings snapshot
- Consensus (Benzinga) as of 2025-08-13
  • META: Consensus rating Buy (value 4.05) from 130 raters; consensus PT $427.46 (wide range $14–$1,086). Note: numerous recent PTs in the $800–$900+ range, suggesting consensus average skews lower from older inputs.
  • SNAP: Consensus rating Hold (value 3.47) from 75 raters; consensus PT $20.41 (range $7–$85), broad dispersion signaling uncertainty.
- Recent rating actions (last ~2 months highlights)
  • META: Broad wave of PT increases post-7/31 results (Barclays $810, JPM $875, Wedbush $920, DA Davidson $825, Stifel $900, Raymond James $900, UBS $897, etc.). Loop Capital raised to $980 on 8/5. Overall skew strongly positive.
  • SNAP: Multiple PT cuts and cautious tones following 8/6 results (Rosenblatt 9→8.7 Neutral; UBS 10→9 Neutral; Piper 10→9 Neutral; Guggenheim 9→8 Neutral). Some earlier summer raises (e.g., Bernstein 9→10 Market Perform) but overall trend more negative to neutral.

News flow and sentiment (Polygon News; max 3 articles/ticker in window)
- META (3 articles, 2025-08-13 to 2025-08-13)
  • Motley Fool: “Billionaire Money Managers Have a Clear Favorite AI Stock — … Not Nvidia or Palantir” (positive for META; favored AI exposure)
  • Motley Fool: “The Trade Desk’s CFO Is Leaving. Is it a Red Flag?” (META neutral mention as competitor)
  • Motley Fool: “Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Be Worth This Much by the End of 2025” (META neutral mention)
  → Aggregate tone: mildly positive.
- SNAP (3 articles, 2025-08-09 to 2025-08-10)
  • Motley Fool: “Is Reddit Stock a Buy…?” (negative mention for SNAP: ad pricing -10% YoY)
  • Motley Fool: “Reddit Stock Pops…” (SNAP neutral mention)
  • Motley Fool: “Prediction: Reddit Stock Could Outperform Meta and Snap…” (SNAP neutral)
  → Aggregate tone: slightly negative.

Qualitative takeaways
- META
  • Strength drivers: Re-accelerating ad demand, AI-driven relevance improvements, Reels monetization, cost discipline, and Reality Labs optionality. Consistent earnings beats and widespread PT hikes supported a strong 1Y return despite spring drawdown.
  • Risks: Ad cycle sensitivity, regulatory scrutiny, capex intensity (AI/data center build), and competition in short-form video and commerce.
- SNAP
  • Headwinds: Ad pricing pressure (-10% YoY mentioned), execution inconsistency, and profitability volatility (GAAP EPS misses in 1H25). Sentiment and PTs reset lower post results.
  • Opportunities: Product innovation (AR/ML), direct-response ads, and cost discipline could stabilize monetization; however, visibility remains limited.

Bottom line
- Over the last 365 days, META delivered strong absolute returns (+49.7%) backed by repeated earnings beats and positive analyst revisions; sentiment is broadly constructive.
- SNAP underperformed (-19.4%) amid mixed fundamentals and cautious/negative rating actions post-earnings; sentiment is neutral-to-negative and dispersion in targets is high, reflecting uncertainty.
